### ðŸŽ¯ Application Purpose
The app serves as a dual-mode travel guide for exploring Dickens-related locations in London's Southwark area. Users can choose between:
- **AI Mode**: Interactive conversations with OpenAI about historical landmarks
- **TTS Mode**: Curated text-to-speech content about travel destinations (currently Riga tour segments)

Users tap a randomly-selected central logo (person1.png or person2.png) to receive location-based content, with pulsating animations indicating when the system is speaking.

## Key Features in Detail

### 1. **Context-Aware Voice Responses**
The app provides context about specific locations when users interact:
```dart
String _extractKeyFact(String talkingPoints) {
  // Extract concise, engaging facts for voice delivery
  final sentences = talkingPoints.split('. ');
  if (sentences.isNotEmpty && sentences[0].length <= 150) {
    return sentences[0] + '.';
  }
  // Smart truncation logic...
}
```

### 2. **Auto-Fact Generation**
Configurable interval-based fact delivery:
- User-selectable intervals (15s, 30s, 45s, 60s, 120s)
- Automatic cycling through different locations
- Intelligent conversation flow management

### 3. **Cost Optimization**
Multiple strategies to minimize OpenAI API costs:
- **Ultra-minimal token limits**: `max_response_output_tokens: 12`
- **Session reuse**: Single connection for multiple interactions
- **Smart queuing**: Prevents redundant API calls
- **Connection management**: Auto-disconnect scheduling

### 4. **Background Noise Strategy**
Current implementation includes:
- **Audio Configuration**: Echo cancellation, noise suppression, auto gain control
- **WebRTC Audio Settings**: Optimized for speech clarity
```dart
'audio': {
  'sampleRate': 24000,
  'channelCount': 1,
  'echoCancellation': true,
  'noiseSuppression': true,
  'autoGainControl': true,
}
```

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.24+ with Dart 3.0+
- iOS Simulator / Android Emulator or physical device
- OpenAI API key with Realtime API access

### Environment Configuration
1. Create `.env` file in project root:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Generate dependency injection:
```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Debug mode
flutter run

# Release mode (iOS/Android)
flutter run --release

# Web (experimental)
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html
```

## How Context Works

### Context Flow
1. **Initial Context**: User taps the central image to trigger location-based facts
2. **Location Detection**: App cycles through pre-loaded Dickens tour locations
3. **AI Processing**: Context + location data sent to OpenAI Realtime API
4. **Voice Response**: AI generates short, engaging facts about the location
5. **Auto-cycling**: Configurable intervals automatically trigger new facts

### Context Storage Per User
```dart
// Context management in LocationContextService
List<LocationData> getAllLocations() => List.unmodifiable(_walkingTourData);

String? getLocationContextByName(String locationName) {
  // Intelligent location matching and context retrieval
}
```

### Context Updates
- **Real-time**: Context updates immediately when new locations are selected
- **Persistence**: App state maintained across sessions
- **Queue Management**: Smart handling of concurrent context requests

## Current UI/UX

The app features a clean, minimal interface:
- **Mode Toggle**: App bar switch between AI and TTS modes
- **Dynamic Central Logo**: Randomly selected person image (person1.png/person2.png) chosen at app startup
- **Pulsating Animation**: Logo pulses when AI is speaking (AI mode) or TTS is reading (TTS mode)
- **Smart Animation Control**: Monitors both AI processing state and TTS speaking state
- **Connection Status**: Real-time WebRTC connection indicator (AI mode only)
- **Interval Selector**: Bottom-left dropdown for auto-fact timing
- **Clean White Background**: Optimized logo display with proper image fitting

## Technical Achievements

## Testing Strategy

Current test structure includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Business logic and services (`test/unit/`)
- **Widget Tests**: UI components and interactions (`test/widget/`)
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end flow testing (`test/integration/`)
- **Mock Data Sources**: Testing without API calls
