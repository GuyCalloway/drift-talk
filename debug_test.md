# Debug Test Checklist

## Current Issues Identified:

1. **DebugService Errors**: These are just Flutter dev tools issues, not app functionality issues
2. **Input Widget**: Fixed reactive send button - should now enable/disable properly when typing
3. **App Status**: App shows "Voice chat connected" - WebRTC connection works

## Quick Testing Steps:

### 1. Open the app (should be running at http://localhost:45xxx)
You should see:
- "Voice AI Assistant" title
- Connection status indicator (should be green/connected) 
- Message input field at bottom
- Send button (grey until you type)

### 2. Test Input Field:
- Click in the message input field
- Type "Hello" - send button should turn blue/primary color
- Delete text - send button should turn grey again
- This confirms the reactive input fix works

### 3. Test Sending (requires valid OpenAI API key):
- Type "Hello, how are you?"
- Click send button or press Enter
- Should see:
  - Message appears in chat
  - Loading indicator briefly
  - Audio response plays automatically via WebRTC

### 4. Browser Console (F12):
- Should see WebRTC connection logs
- No JavaScript errors (except debug service ones)

## Common Issues:

1. **Send button stays grey**: Input fix should resolve this
2. **No audio response**: Check API key validity
3. **Connection fails**: Check browser supports WebRTC (Chrome recommended)
4. **Microphone permission**: Browser should prompt automatically

## Next Debug Steps:

If input is still not working:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify Flutter hot reload is working (type 'r' in terminal)
3. Test on different browser (Chrome recommended)
4. Check if message actually appears in chat when sent
